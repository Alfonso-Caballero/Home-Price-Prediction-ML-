# Madrid Community Real Estate Price Analysis Project

This project aims to collect data on real estate properties in the Community of Madrid through web scraping, process the data, and use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to solve a regression problem related to property prices. In addition, the project includes creating a results presentation and an interactive dashboard using Power BI.

## Introduction

In this project, we have accomplished the following tasks:

1. Web Scraping: Specific information about properties in the Community of Madrid has been gathered from a real estate listings website.
2. Data Preprocessing: The obtained data has been cleaned and properly structured for further analysis.
3. Modeling: Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been applied to predict property prices based on available features.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need to have the following components installed:

- Python 3.11
- Python libraries (check the `utils.py` file for a complete list)

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alfonso-Caballero/Home-Price-Prediction-MLy.git
````
## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `webscraping/`: Contains the code related to data extraction from the website.
- `split_data_eda/`: Cleaning and split train, test for EDA analysis.
- `feature_engineering/`: Includes the data cleaning and preprocessing process.
- `train/`: Contains the machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
- `presentacion/`: Contains a presentation summarizing key findings and results.

## Presentation

In the `presentacion/` directory, you will find a presentation that summarizes key findings and results from this project.

## Dashboard

We have created an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize the results. You can find the dashboard file in the `presentacion/` directory.
